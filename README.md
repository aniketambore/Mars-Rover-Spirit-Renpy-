	So it's my first VN video game written in Renpy (a gaming engine of python).

I would call this project an interactive comic rather than a visual novel or game. I spent much more time on development than i thought. I hope you enjoy it. 

This is a super generous game.

    I've uploaded each and every file in the correct format which was used in the original game as archieve just because you can checkout the whole thing easily.

Use Cases

    This game is bascially a VN like there are two characters, both are talking to each other with the amazing sound effects.
    Actually this game is different from every other Renpy program, Because i tried to make this more user friendly.
    Also this VN contains amazing sound effects for each and every statement commited by the respective characters in the game.
